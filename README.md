Demo notebook by Authentic Data Science

We have prepared a mini notebook for you to explore and try working with data using Python. In this notebook, we won't go into technical details. Instead, let's focus on understanding the concepts described and getting an idea of working with data in Python.
We recommend you to try each operation yourself by pressing the "play" button on the left side next to the code.
Run individual cells linearly - from the top down. If you skip any cells, it could happen that some variable (we'll talk about them later) wouldn't be created, and the cells that come later might not work.
